# RemoteLock

For busy folks who step away from their PC's then get asked to accompany someone and are tired of running back to make sure it's locked.
Also for those using Synergy on multiple PC's who don't want to manually lock each one of them

First, setup the cgi script

Then, run the powershell script in the background

Last, whenever you want to lock just enter your code on your site and it'll lock all PC's running the powershell script


You can save the completed post URL [ Which includes your passcode ] and create a shortcut to it on your phone's homepage so all you have to do is just click the link to lock your pc(s)
